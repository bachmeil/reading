"Exchange Rates and Adjustment: Perspectives from the New Open-Economy Macroeconomics"
Maurice Obstfeld 2002 *Monetary and Economic Studies*

Refers to Engel (2002) as a more technical survey of the same material.

Point of the paper:

> Pessimism over the gross benefits of flexible exchange rates
is a perennial feature of the intellectual landscape, and the newest bout is based on
the observation of extremely low and slow pass-through of exchange rate changes to
consumer prices. I argue below that the recent resurgence of exchange rate pessimism
stems from oversimplified modeling strategies rather than from evidence. 

> the case that exchange rates are an aid in international adjustment remains strong

*Remark:* Is this also true for a country like Spain that has been hit hard due to the adoption of the euro?

The justification for having flexible exchange rates rather than fixed
exchange rates is that changes in the exchange rate will offset output
shocks or international trade shocks (I think that's what he means by
"international payments"). If they don't do so, you're better off with
fixed exchange rates.

*Classic Elasticity Pessimism*: Elasticities of export and import demand
are low enough that the Marshall-Lerner condition does not hold.

Metzler (1948) argued that changes in the exchange rate could not be
expected to bring the trade balance back to zero in the short run. In
the long run exchange rate realignments can be used. *Remark:*
Why is that the purpose of the exchange rate?

*PPP Models*: Exchange rate changes have no effect on goods prices
because prices immediately adjust so that PPP holds.

*Real Wage Rigidity*: With real wage rigidity and flexible exchange
rates, monetary policy cannot affect output. *Remark*: I need to read
one of the references to understand the argument.

*Pricing to Market and Sunk Costs*: If firms are worried about losing
market share due to sunk costs, they will not raise prices above the
prices of domestic firms when the exchange rate changes.

*Local Currency Pricing*: Import prices are assumed to not respond to
exchange rate changes because prices are set in terms of the export
market currency.
