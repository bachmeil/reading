"Exchange Rates and Adjustment: Perspectives from the New Open-Economy Macroeconomics"
Maurice Obstfeld 2002 *Monetary and Economic Studies*

Refers to Engel (2002) as a more technical survey of the same material.

Point of the paper:

> Pessimism over the gross benefits of flexible exchange rates
is a perennial feature of the intellectual landscape, and the newest bout is based on
the observation of extremely low and slow pass-through of exchange rate changes to
consumer prices. I argue below that the recent resurgence of exchange rate pessimism
stems from oversimplified modeling strategies rather than from evidence. 

> the case that exchange rates are an aid in international adjustment remains strong

*Remark:* Is this also true for a country like Spain that has been hit hard due to the adoption of the euro?
